# Quartic Oscillator Problem

This project addresses the following problem:

A mass \( m \) confined to the x-axis has potential energy \( U = k x^4 \) with \( k > 0 \).

(a) Sketch and describe the motion if the mass is initially at rest at \( x = 0 \) and given a sharp kick to the right at \( t = 0 \).

(b) Use the integral expression \( t = \int \frac{dx}{v(x)} \) to find the time for the mass to reach its maximum displacement \( x_{\max} = A \) and thus write the period as an integral.

(c) The integral cannot be expressed in elementary functions; numerically find the period for the case \( m = k = A = 1 \). Provide code.
