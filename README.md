2. [Computer] A mass m confined to the x-axis has potential energy U = k x^4 with k > 0.

(a) Sketch this potential energy and qualitatively describe the motion if the mass is initially stationary at x = 0 and is given a sharp kick to the right at t = 0.

(b) Use t = integral dx / v(x) to find the time for the mass to reach its maximum displacement x_max = A. Give your answer as an integral over x in terms of m, A, and k. Hence find the period tau of oscillations of amplitude A as an integral.

(c) The integral from part (b) cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions, but it can be done numerically. Find the period for the case that m = k = A = 1. Be prepared to submit your code along with your result.


# ANSWER
Period tau = 3.70814935365551
